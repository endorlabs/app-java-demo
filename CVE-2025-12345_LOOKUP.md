# Vulnerability Lookup: CVE-2025-12345

## Request Details
- **Vulnerability ID**: CVE-2025-12345
- **Tool Used**: `endor-labs-get_endor_vulnerability`
- **Date**: December 10, 2025
- **Status**: ⚠️ REQUEST TIMEOUT

## Lookup Attempts
Multiple attempts to retrieve vulnerability information from the Endor Labs database resulted in MCP request timeout errors:

1. **First Attempt**: Request timed out
2. **Second Attempt**: Request timed out

## Tool Information
- **MCP Tool**: `endor-labs/get_endor_vulnerability`
- **Description**: Retrieves vulnerability information from the Endor Labs database
- **Input Parameter**: `vuln_id` (vulnerability name such as CVE-xxxx-xxxx or GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)

## Issue Analysis
The timeout errors are consistent with the previous scan timeout issues:
- The MCP server is running correctly (endorctl v1.7.711, PID 2372)
- Network connections are established (ports 39075 and 30000)
- The MCP request timeout threshold appears insufficient for Endor Labs API operations

## Note on CVE-2025-12345
CVE-2025-12345 appears to be a test or placeholder vulnerability ID, as CVE identifiers for 2025 would not typically be assigned yet in December 2025. Valid CVE IDs follow the format CVE-YYYY-NNNNN where YYYY is the year and NNNNN is a unique number.

## Recommendations
1. Increase MCP request timeout threshold at the infrastructure level
2. Verify the CVE ID is valid and exists in the Endor Labs database
3. Consider using alternative methods to query vulnerability data
4. Check Endor Labs API availability and response times
