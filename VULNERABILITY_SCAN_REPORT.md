## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **CRITICAL - Update Log4j2 immediately**
   - Current: `2.3` (test scope only, but still vulnerable)
   - Recommended: `2.17.0` or later
   - This addresses the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) and related RCE vulnerabilities

2. **HIGH - Update Apache Commons Text**
   - Current: `1.9`
   - Recommended: `1.10.0` or later

3. **HIGH - Update MySQL Connector**
   - Current: `5.1.42`
   - Recommended: `8.2.0` or later
   - Note: This is a major version upgrade and may require code changes

4. **MEDIUM - Update c3p0**
   - Current: `0.9.5.2`
   - Recommended: `0.9.5.4` or later

### Long-term Recommendations

1. **Implement Dependency Scanning in CI/CD**
   - Add automated vulnerability scanning to your build pipeline
   - Consider tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot

2. **Regular Dependency Updates**
   - Establish a process for regular dependency updates
   - Monitor security advisories for all dependencies

3. **Use Dependency Management**
   - Consider using a Bill of Materials (BOM) for consistent dependency versions
   - Leverage Maven's dependency management features

4. **Security Testing**
   - Add security testing to your CI/CD pipeline
   - Perform regular penetration testing and security audits
